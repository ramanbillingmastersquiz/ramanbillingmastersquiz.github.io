            <h2>Why Quizzes Help You Learn Faster</h2>
            <p>Quizzes make learning more active and engaging compared to just reading. Research shows that testing your knowledge helps you remember things better because it forces you to recall information rather than just passively taking it in. This strengthens memory and understanding, making it easier to apply what youâ€™ve learned.</p>
            <p>Quizzes also make learning more fun! They add an interactive, game-like element, keeping you engaged. Plus, when you get instant feedback, you can quickly spot and fix any gaps in your knowledge. Scenario-based questions also help you apply concepts to real-world situations, making them more useful in your day-to-day work.</p>
            
            <h2>Smart, Ever-Changing Questions</h2>
            <p>To keep things fresh and effective, the billing quiz at Octopus Energy updates every seven days using OpenAIâ€™s API. This means that every time you take it, you get slightly different questions. This prevents people from just memorizing answers and encourages deeper understanding over time. Revisiting topics regularly with varied wording helps reinforce learning and keeps knowledge sharp.</p>
            
            <h2>What the Quiz Covers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Billing After An ET</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Billing After a Dispute</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Billing After DMEX</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Data Source</h2>
            <p>The quiz pulls questions from a Knowledge Owl and uses an OpenAI API to rephrase them every seven days.</p>
            <p>Billing KO: <a href="https://octopusenergy.knowledgeowl.com/help/billing">[Knowledge Owl]</a></p>
            <p>API link: <span id="hidden-api">[Hidden]</span></p>

<script>
  const apiKey = "sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"; // Replace with your actual key
  document.getElementById("hidden-api").addEventListener("click", function () {
    alert("You don't need to see this! ðŸ˜‰");
  });
</script>


            
            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>By using AI-powered quizzes with regularly refreshed questions, Octopus Energy makes sure team members keep building their knowledge in a way that actually sticks. This approach not only improves memory and problem-solving skills but also ensures employees are always ready to handle tricky billing situations with confidence and accuracy.</p>
